Spam Classifier Using Word2Vec
This project is a machine learning-based spam classifier that uses Word2Vec embeddings to represent text messages and a Logistic Regression model for classification. The model predicts whether a given message is spam or ham (non-spam).

Features
Word2Vec embeddings trained on the dataset to represent text in vector form.
Logistic Regression classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Support for predicting on new messages.
Model interpretability using SHAP.

Dataset
This project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
